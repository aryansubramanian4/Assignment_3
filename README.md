# WebApp-MBTA - Jaiveer Nalwa & Aryan Subramanian

## 1. Project Overview
The web application designed in this project helps users in Boston find the closest MBTA stop that they can use. The code utilises APIs fetched from Mapbox and the MBTA to obtain geographic data and relevant information about nearby stations. It converts the inputted user location into latitude and longitude coordinates, which is used to query the MBTA API for information about its train stations. The front-end design uses flask servers to render an HTML template with CSS that displays the information for the user in a concise format. 

## 2. Reflection

2. Discuss your team's work division, including how the work was planned to be divided and how it actually happened. Address any issues that arose while working together and how they were addressed. Finally, discuss what you would do differently next time. (DELETE THE QUESTION)

    We believe our team was able to efficiently complete the project because we entered with a clear plan of collaborating together in person to ensure strong communication. We decided to use Live Share for real-time editing and collaboration. Although we initially encountered some minor difficulties, we were able to resolve them promptly. We decided to distribute the work according to our strengths, as Jaiveer worked primarily on the main python file and Aryan worked on the flask server and HTML file, whilst providing input to enhance one another's work.

3. Discuss from a learning perspective, what you learned through this project and how you'll use what you learned going forward. Reflect on how ChatGPT helped you and what you wish you knew beforehand that could have helped you succeed. Consider including screenshots to demonstrate your project's progress and development.
